# JavaScript Calculator

## Introduction

This project implements a basic JavaScript calculator with all the essential math operators commonly found on calculators. It provides an interactive user interface for performing arithmetic operations and displays the results in real-time. The calculator is designed to handle various use cases and includes features such as error handling and a clear button for resetting the input.

## Use Cases

1. **Addition**: Perform addition of two numbers.
2. **Subtraction**: Perform subtraction of two numbers.
3. **Multiplication**: Perform multiplication of two numbers.
4. **Division**: Perform division of two numbers.

A calculator operation consists of a number, an operator, and another number. The calculator's display updates dynamically based on user input and provides feedback for each operation.

## Features

- Basic HTML calculator with buttons for digits and math operators.
- Interactive user interface for inputting numbers and operators.
- Error handling for division by zero.
- Clear button to reset the calculator's input.
- Real-time display of calculated results.

## Implementation

1. **Function Creation**: Define functions for each math operator (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
2. **Display**: Create a display for showing input and results.
3. **Operation**: Implement the operate function to perform calculations based on the selected operator and operands.
4. **HTML Structure**: Design the calculator interface with buttons for digits and operators.
5. **Button Interactivity**: Enable buttons to populate the display with input values.
6. **Calculation**: Implement logic to perform calculations when the equals button is pressed.
7. **Error Handling**: Handle edge cases such as division by zero and input validation.

## Conclusion

Building a JavaScript calculator involves creating functions for basic math operations, designing an intuitive user interface, and implementing logic to handle user input. Through this project, I've gained valuable experience in JavaScript programming, DOM manipulation, and software development practices. This calculator serves as a versatile tool for performing arithmetic operations and demonstrates the power of JavaScript in web development.
